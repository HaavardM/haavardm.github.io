In the future I might\n          (probably not) add Redis support or use a Google Cloud service such as\n          Datastore.\n        </span>\n        <hr />\n        <h2>Part 3: The UI</h2>\n        The UI is simply an extension to this website, a place where I can put\n        all my small projects which do not need an entire setup. This\n        application was built as a custom component in Vue, and simply polls the\n        Rust API frequenctly to retrieve the latest status. Some UI magic later,\n        and you can see the results here.\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n// @ is an alias to /src\nimport AnyoneThere from \"@/components/AnyoneThere.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"AnyoneThereView\",\n  components: {\n    AnyoneThere,\n  },\n};\n</script>\n\n<style scoped lang=\"scss\">\n.text-box {\n  h1 {\n    margin: 2rem;\n  }\n  p {\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n}\n\ncode {\n  display: inline-block !important;\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AnyoneThere.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AnyoneThere.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./AnyoneThere.vue?vue&type=template&id=68958f7b&scoped=true&\"\nimport script from \"./AnyoneThere.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./AnyoneThere.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./AnyoneThere.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=68958f7b&scoped=true&lang=scss&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  \"68958f7b\",\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-3!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AnyoneThere.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=24cc2ea4&scoped=true&lang=scss&\"","export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-3!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./AnyoneThere.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=68958f7b&scoped=true&lang=scss&\""],"sourceRoot":""}
